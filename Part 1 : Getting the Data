If you are using Spotify Premium, you can request your detailed listening data from the Privacy settings on the Spotify Website.
Navigation
- Using your search engine (I’m using Google) type “how to get your spotify data” and click “understanding my data” to reach the Spotify website
- From the top right corner of your website, click “Account” and go to “Security and Privacy”
- Click to “Account privacy” tab and go all the way down. You will see the section with the title “Download your data.”
- In that section you will see three different datasets.

1) Account Data: This datapack includes your general account information such as subscription plans, search queries, playlists etc. This can also be used for analysis if you have good ideas.
2) Extended Streaming History: This datapack includes your extended streaming history, holding what did you listen when, where and how many times, did you skip tracks etc. For this project, I will be using this data.
3) Technical Log Information: This datapack includes technical data for technical thingies. I don’t know its detailed content.
I got my Extended Streaming History the day after I requested it. It came in a rar package, holding my listening history from 2017 to 2025.
 Readmefirst pdf gives information about which column holds what data in details. Be sure to check that before you dive into your project.
