# Spotify-Data-Analysis
In this project, I took my Spotify Streaming History data. I used certain methods and programs to compile, clean and analyze this data to find out about my listening habits.

My main purposes in this project are:
-To practice ms SSIS and Python Pandas Data Analysis skills
-To work with a raw data and cleaning it myself
-To find my top artists and tracks
-To find Date and Time trends in my listening habits
-To find the most skipped, picked and finished tracks
-To find correlations about why I skip a song
-To find if I am prone to listen some band repeatedly or do I explore new bands regularly

This project is seperated into four parts. Each and every part has a different program in use to practice certain skills and to do certain jobs.

Parts:
Part 1: Getting the Data
  In this part, I talk about how you can get your own Extended Streaming History data. This part has no coding or analysis in it. You can skip it if you already know how to get
the data.

Part 2: Transforming and Uploading the Data
  In the second part, I used Python, Excel to transform and SSIS to compile the data. I also used Microsoft SQL Server to create a data warehouse for my compiled data.

Part 3: Cleaning the Data
  In the third part, I cleaned the data in SQL and prepared it for analysis in Python.

Part 4: Exploring and Analysing the Data
  In the fourth and the last part, I took my data into Python and started analysing it according to my main purposes. I used Pandas library for general analysis
and Matplotlib library for simple visualization.
